Question: How to submit an application? Where to find the status of an application?
Answer: To submit an application, you would need to insert a new record into the `loan_applications` table with the required information such as `applicant_id`, `business_id`, `loan_amount`, `loan_purpose`, and `status` (which defaults to 'PENDING'). The `submitted_at` column will automatically be populated with the current timestamp.

To find the status of an application, you can query the `loan_applications` table and retrieve the `status` column for a specific application based on its `id`. The status can be one of the following values: 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'DECLINED', or 'NEEDS_REVIEW'.

Question: How are loan applications related to applicants?
Answer: Loan applications are related to applicants through the `applicant_id` column in the `loan_applications` table. This column is a foreign key that references the `id` column in the `applicants` table. This relationship ensures that each loan application is associated with a specific applicant.

Question: Can a business have multiple loan applications?
Answer: Yes, a business can have multiple loan applications. This can be inferred from the schema by looking at the `loan_applications` table where the `business_id` column is a foreign key referencing the `id` column in the `businesses` table. This relationship allows for multiple loan applications to be associated with a single business.
