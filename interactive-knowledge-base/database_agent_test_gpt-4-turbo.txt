Question: What tables do we have in the database?
Answer: The database contains the following tables:
1. `applicants`
2. `businesses`
3. `loan_applications`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: What fields do we have in an application?
Answer: Based on the schema provided, the fields in the `loan_applications` table, which represents an application, are:

1. `id` - UUID, primary key, uniquely identifies each loan application.
2. `applicant_id` - UUID, foreign key reference to the `applicants` table.
3. `business_id` - UUID, foreign key reference to the `businesses` table.
4. `loan_amount` - Numeric, the amount of the loan requested.
5. `loan_purpose` - Text, the purpose for which the loan is requested.
6. `status` - Varchar, the status of the loan application (can be 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'DECLINED', 'NEEDS_REVIEW').
7. `submitted_at` - Timestamp with time zone, the date and time when the loan application was submitted.

Question: Where do we persist application data?
Answer: The schema provided does not specify where the application data is persisted in terms of the physical storage details (like which database system or server). It only defines the structure of the data within a database through SQL table definitions for `applicants`, `businesses`, and `loan_applications`. Therefore, based on the schema alone, I cannot answer where the application data is physically stored.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Can a business have multiple loan applications?
Answer: Yes, a business can have multiple loan applications. The schema does not restrict the number of loan applications a business can have. Each loan application is identified by a unique `id` and references a `business_id` from the `businesses` table. There is no constraint in the `loan_applications` table that limits each business to only one loan application. Multiple entries in the `loan_applications` table can reference the same `business_id`.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: How to submit an application? Where to find the status of an application?
Answer: Based on the schema provided, there is no direct information on how to submit a loan application or where to find the status of an application in terms of a user interface or an application process flow. The schema primarily defines the structure of the database and the relationships between tables.

However, the schema does indicate where the status of a loan application is stored:
- The status of a loan application is stored in the `status` column of the `loan_applications` table. This column can have values such as 'PENDING', 'APPROVED', 'DECLINED', or 'NEEDS_REVIEW'.

As for submitting an application, this would typically involve inserting a record into the `loan_applications` table with appropriate values for `applicant_id`, `business_id`, `loan_amount`, `loan_purpose`, and optionally setting the `status` (though it defaults to 'PENDING'). The actual process of submitting an application would likely be handled through a user interface or an API that interacts with the database, but details of that interface or API are not provided in the schema.

Question: Generate sql query to get application status by user email
Answer: Based on the schema provided, you can generate an SQL query to retrieve the application status by user email by joining the `applicants` and `loan_applications` tables. Here is the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT la.status
FROM loan_applications la
JOIN applicants a ON la.applicant_id = a.id
WHERE a.email = 'example@email.com';
```

Replace `'example@email.com'` with the actual email address for which you want to check the application status. This query will return the status of all loan applications associated with the specified email address.
