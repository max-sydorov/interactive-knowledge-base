Question: What tables do we have in the database?
Answer: The database contains the following tables:
1. applicants
2. businesses
3. loan_applications
--------------------------------------------------
Question: What fields do we have in an application?
Answer: The fields in an application are: id, applicant_id, business_id, loan_amount, loan_purpose, status, and submitted_at.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: How are loan applications related to applicants?
Answer: Loan applications are related to applicants through the 'applicant_id' field in the 'loan_applications' table. This field is a foreign key that references the 'id' field in the 'applicants' table. This means that each loan application is associated with one applicant.
--------------------------------------------------
Question: Can a business have multiple loan applications?
Answer: Yes, a business can have multiple loan applications. The schema does not restrict a business to only one loan application. The business_id in the loan_applications table is a foreign key referencing the id in the businesses table, but there is no unique constraint on the business_id in the loan_applications table, which means multiple rows (i.e., multiple loan applications) can have the same business_id.
