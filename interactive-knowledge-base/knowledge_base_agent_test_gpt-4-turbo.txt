Question: What is the Quick Loan Platform?


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...


Thought: The question is asking for a general description of the Quick Loan Platform, which is provided in the system overview.

Final Answer: The Quick Loan Platform is an online platform designed for small business loan application intake. It features a streamlined web-based interface using a ReactJS frontend, a Java Spring Boot backend with decisioning logic, and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The platform operates on a three-tier architecture, including a presentation tier for user interface, an application tier for backend processing, and a data tier for data storage. The workflow involves users filling out a multi-step form, data validation and submission, backend processing with decisioning logic, and updating the application status which is stored and retrieved from PostgreSQL.

Question: How does the application process work?


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...


Thought: The question asks for a description of the application process, which is outlined in the system overview under the Workflow section. No need to use any tools for this.

Final Answer: The application process on the Quick Loan Platform involves several steps:
1. The user completes a multi-step form on the frontend.
2. The frontend performs client-side validation and submits the data to the backend API.
3. The backend receives the data, performs server-side validation, persists the data, and executes the loan decisioning logic.
4. The decision and application status are then stored in the PostgreSQL database.
5. The frontend continuously polls or queries the backend to get updates on the application status.

Question: What tables do we have in the database?


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...


Thought: I need to use a tool to help me answer the question about the database tables.
Action: query_database
Action Input: What tables are in the PostgreSQL database?

The PostgreSQL database contains the following tables:

1. `applicants`
2. `businesses`
3. `loan_applications`

I know the answer now.

Question: Can a business have multiple loan applications?


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...


Thought: Based on the system overview, there is no specific mention of restrictions on the number of loan applications a business can submit. However, to confirm whether the system allows multiple applications per business, I need to check the database schema to see if there are any constraints that would prevent a business from having multiple applications.

Action: query_database
Action Input: What are the constraints on the loan applications table regarding multiple entries for the same business?

The schema for the `loan_applications` table does not specify any constraints that would prevent multiple entries (loan applications) for the same business. The `business_id` column in the `loan_applications` table is a foreign key that references the `id` in the `businesses` table, ensuring that any `business_id` entered in the `loan_applications` table must exist in the `businesses` table. However, there is no unique constraint or other restriction on the `business_id` in the `loan_applications` table that would limit the number of loan applications a single business can have. Therefore, multiple loan applications for the same business are allowed according to the given schema.

I know the answer now.
Final Answer: Yes, a business can have multiple loan applications on the Quick Loan Platform. The database schema does not impose any constraints that would prevent a business from submitting multiple applications.

Question: How to submit an application? Where to find the status of an application?


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...


Thought: The question pertains to the workflow of the Quick Loan platform, specifically about submitting an application and checking its status. I can answer this based on the system overview provided.

Thought: I know the answer now.
Final Answer: To submit an application on the Quick Loan platform, a user must fill out a multi-step form on the frontend. This form is part of the ReactJS single-page application. After filling out the form, the frontend performs client-side validation and then submits the data to the backend API.

To find the status of an application, the frontend will poll or query the backend for updates. The application status, once processed by the backend, is stored in the PostgreSQL database and is made available to the frontend through the backend API. Users can check the status directly on the platform where they submitted their application.

Question: Generate sql query to get application status by user email


> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...


Thought: I need to generate an SQL query to retrieve the application status based on the user's email. This involves knowing the database schema, specifically the table and fields related to user emails and application statuses.

Action: query_database
Action Input: What tables contain user email and application status?

The tables that contain user email and application status are:

1. **applicants** - This table contains the user email in the column `email`.
2. **loan_applications** - This table contains the application status in the column `status`.

To generate the SQL query, I need to know if there is a relationship between the `applicants` and `loan_applications` tables, such as a foreign key or a common column that links these tables.

Action: query_database
Action Input: How are the applicants and loan_applications tables related?

The `applicants` and `loan_applications` tables are related through a foreign key relationship. The `loan_applications` table has a column named `applicant_id` which is a foreign key referencing the `id` column of the `applicants` table. This relationship means that each record in the `loan_applications` table is linked to a record in the `applicants` table, indicating which applicant submitted the loan application. The foreign key constraint is enforced with the following SQL constraint in the `loan_applications` table:

```sql
CONSTRAINT fk_applicant
    FOREIGN KEY(applicant_id)
    REFERENCES applicants(id)
    ON DELETE RESTRICT
```

This constraint ensures that a loan application cannot exist without a corresponding applicant, and it restricts the deletion of an applicant from the `applicants` table if there are associated loan applications in the `loan_applications` table.

I know the answer now.
Final Answer: The SQL query to retrieve the application status based on a user's email would be:

```sql
SELECT la.status
FROM loan_applications la
JOIN applicants a ON la.applicant_id = a.id
WHERE a.email = 'user@example.com';
```

This query joins the `loan_applications` table with the `applicants` table on the `applicant_id` and retrieves the `status` of the loan application for a specific email address. Replace `'user@example.com'` with the actual email address to query for a specific user.
