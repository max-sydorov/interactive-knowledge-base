Question: What is the Quick Loan Platform?
Answer: The Quick Loan Platform is an online platform designed for small business loan application intake. It features a streamlined web-based interface that allows users to fill out a multi-step form for loan applications. The platform uses a three-tier architecture consisting of:

1. **Presentation Tier (Frontend):** A ReactJS single-page application (SPA) that runs in the user's browser. It is responsible for rendering the user interface, capturing user input, performing client-side validation, and communicating with the backend API.

2. **Application Tier (Backend):** A Java/Spring Boot RESTful API that handles requests, performs server-side validation, executes business logic including loan decisioning, and interacts with the data persistence layer.

3. **Data Tier (Persistence):** A PostgreSQL relational database used for storing and retrieving application details and decision outcomes.

The workflow involves the user filling out the loan application form on the frontend, which then validates and submits the data to the backend. The backend further validates the data, persists it, and runs decisioning logic to determine the loan outcome. The decision and application status are stored in the database, and the frontend can poll or query for updates on the application status.

Question: How does the application process work?
Answer: The application process on the Quick Loan platform involves several steps:

1. **User fills out a multi-step form on the frontend:** The user, typically a small business owner, accesses the platform through a web browser and fills out a form designed to capture all necessary information for a loan application. This form is part of the ReactJS single-page application.

2. **Frontend validates and submits data to the backend API:** As the user completes each step of the form, the frontend performs client-side validation to ensure that the data entered meets the required formats and constraints. Once validation is passed, the data is submitted to the backend.

3. **Backend validates, persists data, and runs decisioning logic:** The backend, built with Java Spring Boot, receives the data and performs additional server-side validation. It then saves the data to the PostgreSQL database and processes it using decisioning logic to determine whether the loan can be approved.

4. **Decision and application status are stored in PostgreSQL:** The outcome of the decisioning logic, along with the overall status of the loan application, is stored in the database.

5. **Frontend polls or queries for application status updates:** After submission, the frontend may periodically poll the backend or query it to receive updates on the status of the loan application, allowing the user to see whether their application has been approved, denied, or if further information is needed.

This streamlined process is designed to make it as efficient as possible for small businesses to apply for loans.

Question: What tables do we have in the database?
Answer: The tables in the database are:

1. `applicants`
2. `businesses`
3. `loan_applications`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Question: Can a business have multiple loan applications?
Answer: Yes, a business can have multiple loan applications. The database schema does not restrict the number of loan applications a business can have. Each loan application is identified by a unique `id` and is linked to a business through the `business_id` foreign key in the `loan_applications` table. There is no constraint in the schema that limits each business to only one loan application.

Question: How to submit an application? Where to find the status of an application?
Answer: To submit a loan application on the Quick Loan Platform, follow these steps:

1. **Fill out the application form:** Navigate to the Quick Loan Platform and complete the multi-step form provided on the frontend. This form will capture all necessary details required for your loan application.
2. **Validation and submission:** The frontend will perform client-side validation of your input. Once all data is validated and complete, the form data is submitted to the backend via the platform's API.

To find the status of your application:

1. **Check updates on the frontend:** After submitting your application, the frontend will continue to poll or query the backend for updates on the status of your application.
2. **Notification of decision:** Once the decisioning process is completed by the backend, any updates or the final decision will be displayed on the frontend interface where you submitted your application.

This process ensures that you are kept informed of your application's progress and outcome directly through the platform's user interface.

Question: Generate sql query to get application status by user email
Answer: Based on the information retrieved from the database, here is the SQL query to get the application status by user email:

```sql
SELECT la.status
FROM loan_applications la
JOIN applicants a ON la.applicant_id = a.id
WHERE a.email = 'user@example.com';
```

This query joins the `loan_applications` table with the `applicants` table on the applicant ID, and filters for the specific email address to retrieve the application status. Replace `'user@example.com'` with the actual email address you want to query.
